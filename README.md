# Digital Cookbook 22/12/2020

This is a test/exam

Here we have a project where you can create, read and store recipes for basicly anything, be it drinks, food, or something else.

Teacher just so you know, i didnt write: "// EKSEMPEL Metode" because i could do that on everything.

## There are 2 branches, the master branch is the real handover, and the Half-fix-for-saveload-feature branch is for when i tried to fix an error, read more below

### Error - Future sigths and ideas

So first of all, the save and load feature is not working because of the FXML elements not being serializable, i began making a workaround, but the time ran out. If i had like an hour or two more, i think i could have done it, but we ended it 14:50 and found the error 14:00, so i only made half of the workaround, but because it is not finished it is therefore not being pushed to another branch.
